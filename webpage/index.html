        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Campus Safety Website aims to provide the UIUC community with up-to-date information about safety incidents 
            on campus. By analyzing historical data, the website helps users understand trends and patterns in campus 
            safety incidents.
            The website includes interactive maps, visualizations, and machine learning models to predict and analyze safety
             incidents.</p>
